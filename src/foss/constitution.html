		<h1>Constitution</h1>
		<h2>Preamble</h2>
		<p>It is important to recognize the danger that bureaucracy can get in the way of doing cool things. This constitution is an attempt to provide the means to ensure that the club can run smoothly and it should be invoked in compliance with the spirit of the club.</p>
		<h2>Article 1: Club Name and Purpose</h2>
		<h3>1: Name</h3>

		<h3>2: Purpose</h3>
		<p>The purpose of foss@bphc is to write and advocate free software, and to create a community of excellent programmers.</p>
		<p>The club shall take no 'official' stance on political debates among the open source community, and shall not place any constraints on the type of project and/or tools used to accomplish the tasks by the members, as long as the project worked on by members of the club, under the flag of the club, and distributed by the club should meet some acceptable definition of open source software.</p>
		<h2>Article 2: Membership</h2>
		<p>The club has three main types of memberships to offer:</p>
